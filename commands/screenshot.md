description: Take a screenshot of the current page
---

Take a screenshot of the current browser page and analyze its contents.

If the browser hasn't been started yet, ask for a URL first, navigate there, then take the screenshot.

Use the `screenshot` tool with fullPage=$ARGUMENTS if specified (true/false), otherwise use default viewport.
